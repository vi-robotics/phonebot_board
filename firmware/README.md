# Embedded

Phonebot (Arduino) embedded developments, including firmware and sample apps.

## Running

The main firmware is located in the [firmware directory](firmware) and contains a `.ino` file which is runnable by the Arduino IDE as well as additional `.cpp` and `.h` files. For detailed instructions on how to install Arduino and flash the firmware, see [the docs](https://github.com/vi-robotics/phonebot_docs/blob/main/electrical/firmware_setup.md). Additional apps are located in the [apps directory](apps), and each sudirectory contains a `.ino` file which can be loaded onto PhoneBot using the same setup as described in the docs.

## Firmware

See the [firmware](firmware) directory, which contains our main firmware library to communicate with the PhoneBot App.
